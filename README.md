# Homework #6

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* Functions - is a unit of code that can be used over and over.  It is both a time saving method and a way to simplify so you can write cleaner easier to read code.  You call the function to utilize it.  You can call the function in the javascript console or in the script itself.  The function contains arguments, i.e. add a and b where a and b are numbers or where a and b are strings, which will be completed when the funtion is called without having to write out so much code.


	* Parameters - parameters and arguments are often confused when talking about functions in JavaScript.  The parameter is used to define the function.  What this means is that although both parameters are referring to the similar information inside the parenthesis the parameter is really being used before the function is actually used. 


	* Arguments - arguments differ from parameters in that they are what is being used in the function.  So it is not the defintion but what happens when the function is used.  Arguments can change and are often changed using slightly different numbers or logic which will result in a possible change from true to false.


	* `if` statements - an if statement is a function that is used to decide if something is true or false.  This is usually shown to get a result of some amount of options.  For example if something is true or false we would produce one greeting vs. a different greeting for false.  The easiest one I have seen is if you have a long name using the length of someones name.  If someone's first name is greater than or equal to 7 letters we can say "Hi, you have a long name" or if that is not true we can produce "Hi, you have a short name".  This can get more complicated very quickly with if/else statements or with using more complicated results however the thought is the same.. if statements are for providing branching paths based on the argument used in the function so only the chosen correct path is used as a result.

2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/

3. Download (clone) this project folder from GitHub.

4. Navigate into the downloaded folder using Terminal(Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows).  `ls`(Mac), `dir`(Windows) and `cd <directory_name>` are the commands you need to navigate around.

5. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.

6. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass.
